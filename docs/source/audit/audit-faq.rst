Why does goss run manually fail?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

example:

.. code-block:: bash
    goss -g goss.yml -v

Goss is designed to run from the scripts passing values into goss for metadata. Without these values being set goss fails. These values can bee seen towards the end of the goss.yml file
