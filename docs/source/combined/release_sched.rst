Release Schedule
================


CIS
---

CIS (Center for Internet Security) releases developed security configurations and best practices that the community validates.
There is no official schedule, although CIS tends to release new or updated benchmarks in a draft format, which individuals can subscribe to prior to an official release.

STIG
----

STIG (Security Technical Implementation Guide) releases are developed by vendors in conjunction with requirements from DISA.
STIG release schedule is managed and released on a quarterly schedule.

Playbook Releases
-----------------

We aim to release remediate benchmarks within 30 days of vendor release to subscribers, this is subject to the number of changes, with new benchmarks often taking significantly longer.
Public releases will be approximately three months after subscriber release.
