Contributing
------------

Commonly with GitHub open-source repositories and projects,
community contributions are via GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.

We do ask the following:

- Respect the community's time and effort that gets put into feedback and support.
- Provide as much information as possible with issues or pull request.
- Pull Requests:

  - **signed-off-by (user is provided)**
  - **signed-by (gpg key signed)**
